# Tipaw Take-home challenge

## 🚀 Briefing

### 🌐 Backend

The backend API should be able to receive the frontend data, and store it in a local database.

## 📚 Tech stack

We would like to test your knowledge and the following technologies, so we do ask that you use atleast:

- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/)
- [**Typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **ES6+**
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [**Emotion.js**](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling

Feel free to use any technologies in addition to those mentionned above. No library is off limits.

## 🎯 Criteria

Your submission of the challenge will be judged, among other things, by the following points:

- **UI/UX** should be pleasing, and user friendly accross multiple devices and resolutions.
- **Readability** of the code (aka clean code code)
- Conscious **design/technical decisions**
- **Technical knowledge** of the required technologies
- **Performance** of both applications

## ✨ Bonus points

- Server side rendering (even though not useless here, we are curious to see how you would do it)
- Using GraphQL + Prisma + PostgresQL for the backend
- Automated tests
- A way for users to login (session management)
- Building a design system for the UI components
- A clear project architecture
- Deploy the applications

## 📝 Final note

We recommend that you spend a **maximum of 4 hours** on this challenge. Your goal should not be to deliver a final product, but more for us to have enough to test your knowledge and understanding of the technologies.

Do not using any templates, pre-build tutorials, or any code that is not written by yourself for the majority of the challenge.

We hope you will enjoy working on this challenge, and if you have any questions
please do not hesitate to react out to **pmoens@tipaw.com**
